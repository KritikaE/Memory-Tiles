# Memory-Tiles

The Memory Game – Flipping Tiles is a Java-based desktop application developed using the Swing framework.

The main objective of this project is to create an interactive tile-matching game where players flip tiles to find matching pairs within a grid layout. The game features a graphical user interface with clickable tiles that reveal hidden images or symbols when selected, challenging players to remember tile positions and make successful matches.

The application demonstrates core concepts of Java GUI development, event handling, game logic implementation, and dynamic component state management. This project is simple, lightweight, and ideal for understanding how interactive memory-based games work at a fundamental level.
